          Hello, I am a software engineer with 2 yearsâ€™ experience in full stack web development. My UTS coursework spanned a wide range of areas such as networking, web security, signal processing and embedded software. I enjoyed signal processing the most and have applied that knowledge in creating an app that can identify musical tones over a microphone.

          <Typography variant="body1">
I am currently a software developer at Abyss Solutions and have developed key functionalities for an app that involves interfacing with a 3d model. I think the biggest takeaway I have from my work experience is that I like working with and supporting others, getting good work done and creating a team that feels fulfilled by their work, and happily improving.

I am seeking a mid-level software engineering role where I can leverage my experience in designing and implementing full-stack web components. I value writing robust, reusable, and extendable code. And continuously learning about new technologies and workflows that uplift my team and work.
