              While working for SeaLadder, I helped onboard new interns. I also mentored them through pair programming sessions and code reviews. I covered best coding practices, our tech stack, code architecture, test driven development, and knowledge sharing.

              I led a basic computer skills class at Karabi Community Services Seven Hills. I designed a curriculum for the elderly spanning topics from basic interfacing with Windows and Mac machines, introduction to the web and emails, basic web security (like safe internet use), protecting personal data. I wrote all the learning material and external resources on a WordPress site for them.
