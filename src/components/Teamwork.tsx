              &rdquo;I had the privilege of working alongside Edric at Abyss Solutions and was impressed by his curiosity, technical expertise, and his exceptional ability to cultivate positive team dynamics.
Edric consistently showcased unwavering dedication and enthusiasm, delivering great work under tight deadlines while adapting quickly to changes in approach. Iâ€™ve watched his interest in and understanding of product design grow which aided greatly in our collaboration. He has a talent for sparking engaging conversations and creating a vibrant team environment. Moreover, his kindness and approachability had a significant impact on boosting overall team morale. He was always one of the first to check in with the team and see how people are going.
It has been a pleasure working with Edric.&rdquo;
